## üîß Technical Details

### Encryption
- **Algorithm**: AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard - Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Size**: 256 bits
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with SHA-256, 100,000 iterations
- **IV**: Random 12-byte initialization vector for each encryption

### Storage
- **Method**: Browser localStorage
- **Format**: JSON with encrypted data and IV
- **Capacity**: ~5-10MB depending on browser

### Security Features
1. **Master Password Hashing**: Never stored in plain text
2. **Session Management**: Secure token-based authentication
3. **Encryption Keys**: Derived from master password, never stored
4. **Auto-Lock**: Prevents unauthorized access
5. **Clipboard Auto-Clear**: Reduces exposure risk
6. **XSS Prevention**: HTML escaping for all user inputs

## üéØ Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Supported | Version |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Chrome  | ‚úÖ | 60+ |

| Safari  | ‚úÖ | 11+ |
| Edge    | ‚úÖ | 79+ |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Security Considerations
1. **Master Password**: Choose a strong, unique master password
2. **Browser Storage**: Data stored in localStorage can be accessed by browser extensions
